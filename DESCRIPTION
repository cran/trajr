Description: A toolbox to assist with statistical analysis of animal trajectories.
    It provides simple access to algorithms for calculating and assessing a variety of 
    characteristics such as speed and acceleration, as well as multiple measures of 
    straightness or tortuosity. Some support is provided for 3-dimensional trajectories.
